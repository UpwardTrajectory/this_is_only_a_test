There once was a number who felt unwanted by her peers. She wasn't accepted 
by any of the popular cliques like the "Naturals" or the "Rational". One day she decided to end it all and asked zero for help. "Please be my divisor!" she pleaded. Thankfully, zero declined. This young number went on to great things! Way to go (pi^2 / 6). Way to go.
